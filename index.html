                I love playing games with friends but they are sometimes busy
                when I want to play. I have never been a fan of playing world
                wide with strangers. This allows me that happy both.

                I have tried other apps in the past but its always hard to weed
                out the weirdos. This app has so many people in so many areas
                playing a wide varity of games. So you will find your group.
